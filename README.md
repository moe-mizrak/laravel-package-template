# Laravel Package Template
My opinionated template for the Laravel packages

(Inspired by: https://github.com/spatie/package-skeleton-laravel)

## Get Started
> Follow these steps to get started:
> 1. Press the "Use this template" button at the top of this repo to create a new repo with the contents of this template.
> 2. Run following script which will replace all placeholders throughout all the files. 
>   ```bash
>   php ./build.php
>   ```
>   
> 3. That's it! Now you have a new Laravel package scaffolded and ready to be developed.

## Installation
You can install the package (that you created with this template) via composer:
  ```bash
  composer require :vendor_slug/:package_slug
  ```

You can publish and run the migrations with:
  ```bash
  php artisan vendor:publish --tag=":package_slug-config"
  ```
